# extratorch
A collection of extra functionality for PyTorch, which I find useful. There are probably other libraries that do this better.

The source files are placed `extratorch/` directory.
There are some examples in `examples/`. The `examples/` directory contains the [original tasks](https://github.com/alexarntzen/deepthermal) that the library was written for. Se
The tests are placed in `test/` directory. 

To run all the test run: 

```
python3 -m unittest
```
from in the top level directory.
